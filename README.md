1. # ONDO CORRECTIONAL HOME ANALYSIS

2. ## OVERVIEW
I analyzed data from the *Ondo State Correctional Home* using Power BI to understand the profile of children in custody. My goal was to explore demographics, offences, referral modes, case statuses, and welfare indicators. The dashboard highlights critical insights such as gender and age distribution, common offences, stalled cases, and welfare gaps like missing contact persons. These findings can guide policymakers, social workers, and child protection stakeholders in strengthening child rights and rehabilitation processes.

3. ## OBJECTIVES
To examine the demographics of children (age, gender, and documentation status).
* To analyze offences leading to admission and referral modes.
* To assess case statuses (ongoing vs. stalled).
* To review welfare indicators such as contact person details and pre-incident living arrangements.
* To track month of admission over time.

4. ## TOOLS USED
* Power BI - Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.
* Charts & Visuals - To show demographics, offences, referral modes, and trends.
* Slicers - For interactive filtering by gender and contact person.
* KPI - To highlight total children and other key metrics.

6. ## KEY INSIGHTS
* Majority of children admitted were male, with age distribution concentrated in teenage years.
* Court referrals accounted for most admissions.
* Some cases remain stalled, delaying justice and rehabilitation.
* Many children lacked identified caregivers or contact persons, showing welfare risks.
* The analysis revealed variations in the number of children admitted each month, pointing to irregular admission patterns.

7. ## RECOMMENDATIONS
* Fast-track stalled cases through improved judicial follow-ups.
* Provide psychosocial and caregiver support for children lacking identified contact persons.
* Monitor seasonal trends to allocate resources proactively.
* Enhance collaboration between courts, parents, and child rights agencies to improve referral and rehabilitation processes.

8. ## CONCLUSIONS

This project provided a structured analysis of children in custody at the Ondo State Correctional Home using Power BI. By visualizing demographics, offences, case statuses, and welfare indicators, it uncovered patterns that highlight systemic gaps such as missing documentation and inadequate caregiver support. The findings reinforce the importance of data-driven approaches in strengthening child rights advocacy, improving case management, and guiding stakeholders toward more effective rehabilitation and welfare policies.
